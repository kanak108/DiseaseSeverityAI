**Abstract:**
This project employs machine learning techniques to predict disease severity using collected data. By analyzing patterns and relationships within the dataset, the model aims to provide accurate predictions of disease severity, facilitating early intervention and informed medical decisions.

**Motivation:**
Incorporating the principles of Ayurveda, a holistic approach to medicine, this project seeks to harness the power of machine learning for predicting disease severity. By merging ancient wisdom with modern technology, the motivation behind this endeavor is to enhance healthcare outcomes by providing early insights into disease progression. This fusion of traditional knowledge and advanced analytics holds the potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics and interventions.

**Software Aspect of the Project**

**Tech Stack Overview:**
